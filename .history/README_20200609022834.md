### Flickr API Keys:
This app uses the Flickr API to get the photos associated to location. In order to use this app, you'll have to provide your own Flickr API key. To configure it, you'll need to add a new file called <strong>keys.xcconfig</strong>, inside the <strong>Supporting Files/Secrets/</strong> folder.

Inside this file you can place your api key like this: <code>FLICKR_API_KEY = YOUR_API_KEY_HERE</code>. There's also a keys.example.xcconfig file you can use to copy this simple configuration.
